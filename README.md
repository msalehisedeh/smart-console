# Welcome to Smart Console!

Have you ever been in need of suppressing console logs? Have you thought of a tool that can help you suppress logs based on type, caller, level, or anything else that I cannot think of? Or maybe you DO NOT want to disable a log but want to throttle it! And what if you just want to watch for occurrence of a log? 
You can use this tool to have your application do all of that and maybe a bit more! 

**NOTE:** http related 403, 500, ... logs are issued natively by zon.js as a result they are out of JavaScript reach and this tool do not have any control over them.

**I appreciate comments and ideas to make this tool versatile.**
